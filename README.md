# ConÂ·notes

A server-less note-taking webapp with a notational velocity like GUI that syncs
via DropBox or other third-party backends.

## Installation

    npm install

should take care of installing all dependencies.

    grunt dist

creates the deployment-ready version in `dist/`. Use `--dist-path=foo` to
install to directory `foo/` instead.
